## Overview

This project was done for the the UCL module ECON0023 International Trade, during my Student Exchange Programme.

## Description

We were to analyse an event using theoretical trade models studied in the syllabus. We used the Standard Trade Model and provided suggestive empirical evidence through a Fixed Effects regression to support our theories.
