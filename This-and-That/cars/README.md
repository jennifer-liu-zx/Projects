## Car Sales SQL Project

### Overview

This project uses Python and PostgreSQL to build a small analytics pipeline for car sales data.

### Data

Data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/missionjee/car-sales-report). 
The dataset is relatively small, so the insights are not generally applicable, but still indicative of the preferences and trends in the small number of regions represented in the dataset.

### Description

This project was done to practice SQL and apply it to a real dataset. 
I perform systematic data quality checks and investigate 16 business questions. 
The cleaned and aggregated results are finally pulled into Jupyter notebooks
